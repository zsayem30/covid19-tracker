# covid19-tracker
###Tracker app summary
This is an app which helps user to track their symptoms for Covid-19, 
individuals who came in contact with the user, 
and also the location of places the user visited.
The app prompts the user to track their symptoms, 
other user they have come in contact with and the places they have visited for 14 days, 
and after the 14 day incubation period, 
the app will provide a percentage of how closely the user symptoms match with symptoms outlined on CDC/WHO.
Based on this percentage value, a guideline is given to the user to take the necessary precaution (based on their respective region). <br />
If the symptoms of the user has a high match rating with the symptoms on CDC/WHO then health authorities are immediately contacted and the user is tested. 
The health officials can access the user data upon approval from the user. If the test results are positive, then all the individuals the user has come in contact with for the past 2 weeks are alerted that they possibly
might have contracted covid-19 and are informed to self quarantine. 
Additionally, areas with users who have tested positive for covid-19 are marked red which other users can see with their maps and if they do leave their house, they are informed to avoid those areas.
The intensity of the color of these marked areas decrease eventually with time.
The analysis of the location collected will allow government to track communities where the virus is spreading more thus allowing better allocation of resources.
